Documentation Log for "A Day in Utopia"


v0.0.4:
-------
x Chapter 1 pt 2b (aka the Lana route) expanded on, one battle done, one exploration section done.
x Main file further divided into story subsections to reduce denseness of code.
x battleMechanics() updated to include NPC action.
x Character class updated to include Beyonder pathway choice, although story-wise it hasn't been reached yet.
x battleCounter added to keep track of events that cause changes in battle (ie low player health, NPC assistance).
x NPC switched from private to public class due to above need for accessing their variables.

[bugs in this version: ...]


v0.0.3:
-------
x Save function rehauled to be string instead of integer.
x Savecode generation and degradation into eventCounter array well-defined.
x Separate event counters combined into one to make save function implementation easier.
x Chapter 1 finished upto eventCounter[4] (previously c1EventCounter[2]).

[bugs in this version: 1) save function is rudimentary and may be capable of being circumvented
                        (ie for pos=1, no string position other than first four are checked)
                            -solution: TBD
                       2) save function cannot keep track of variables like item usage and character stats.
                            -solution: TBD, *for the latter, if the system is still fixed battles, maybe allow player to allocate stats all at once?
                              or for non-fixed battles, add a position in the savecode for the character level and allow complete stat allocation]
                       3) giving string input for an integer option (ie: belief) causes "invalid choice" to be repeated ad-infinitum.
                            -solution: TBD. Maybe make it a string option then either conversion into integer for switch-cases or nested else-if
                            ladder.



Latest changes in detail:
-------------------------
1) Chapter 1 pt 2b
x Expanded upon to include a battle and an exploration.
x 1.2a still not done.

2) Slime stats, Lana's emblem
x Messed around with both to make the optional battle 2 winnable but difficult.
x Lana's emblem nerfed, Slime stats adjusted.

3) Story subsections
x Current divisions are as Prologue, Chapter 1 pt 1 and 2, Chapter 1 pt 2a and Chapter 1 pt 2b (the last two being separate files as they are separate routes).



Things to do:
-------------
1) Complete Chapter 1 part 2b.
2) Divide story file into separate chapters.
3) Improve save function.
4) Maybe use hit chance / effect resistance as an in-built factor to make LUCK matter in battle (currently intended as event-only factor)


Other notes:
------------
x Should 'flee' be added to battle options? This will make it user-thoughtful if randomising encounters (ie, during explorations).
  Otherwise the battles are pre-determined.
x Should there be a scalability factor for monsters? Ie, their stats increase based on the level you're at? This works for the current setting
  but would be more appropriate for a game with randomised encounters (think Tactics Ogre KoL).

x Remember 0=false, 1=true (or similar) for all integer-based functions and variables, so that consistency is ensured.

x eventCounter[0] is for Lana, 1 means captain has been spoken to, 2 means second mate has been spoken to, 3 means Lana has been given the bottle
  of essential scent, 4 means she has been saved and added to the party, 5 and 7 are responses (open anger or not) to her revelation, 6 and 8 are for cooling down.
x eventCounter[1] is about Gehrman, 1 means you've spoken to the captain, 2 means you've spoken to Azik about it
x eventCounter[2] is about religious belief.
x eventCounter[3] is for exploring the buildings.
x eventCounter[4] is for winning the first battle with >10 HP.
x eventCounter[5] is for noticing the buildings (ch1.pt2b).
x eventCounter[6] is for Calder√≥n City (ch1.pt2b).

x battleCounter[0] is for if Lana is present in the party or not.
x battleCounter[1] is for situations where player starts battle at 3/4 health. (1/2 was planned, but way too challenging)

Older versions
--------------

v0.0.2:
-------
x Battle functions introduced and completed.
x Introduced randomness for hit chance and critical-hit chance.
x Chapter 1 done without c1EventCounter[1] being set (ie, no choice).
x Redid Prologue pt1 (the original story was Y/N being approved by the Society, but now their expedition is with friends + volunteers 
including one Society member, as it doesn't make narrative sense that the Society would let a non-Beyonder head an expedition to a clearly
supernatural place like Utopia).
x Included string blankSpace to space out the text paragraphs.

[bugs in this version: 1) yn() return was off due to adding "return 2;" to prevent "control reaches end of non-void function" warning
                            -solution: remove the unnecessary return, code runs in spite of warning
                       2) several issues with the battle functions, namely due to improper pointer usage and improper randomness of rand()
                            -solution: remove battle randomness, change pointer usage in functions to call by value ]


v0.0.1:
-------
x Started work.
x Built opening menu, save functions, Prologue pt1 and pt2.
x Defined the classes (Character to NPC, Protag and Monster; Item).
x shipEventCounters are set.
