# A Day in Utopia
You are an archaeologist who has long been searching for the mysterious vanished town of Utopia. When you believe you've finally found it, you amass a team of eleven for the expedition and set off. But there is a reason why the town vanished as it did, and perhaps you would have been better off never looking into it at all...

'A Day in Utopia' is a text adventure RPG with battle mechanics, based on a Chinese webnovel, Lord of Mysteries, but capable of standing independently to some extent. It is a non-profit transformative work adhering to the principles of fair use.

## General Info
The game consists of mainly three parts: story, exploration and battle. All aspects will be explained by in-game tutorials as they are come across.
In regards to LOTM, the game occurs after the ending of the first book, and ignores some of the additional stories. Spoilers abound.

The current version of the game is a demo that only reaches till Chapter 1.
